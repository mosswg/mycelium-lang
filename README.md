 # mxs

 ## std library
 The mxs std library is entirely written in assembly for x86_64 linux with no dependencies. Eventually it may be expanded to include other platforms or architectures. <br>
 Currently the std library is the only part of the project. Once the std library is extensive enough work on the actual language will begin. <br>
